	Abstract = {In this paper, we are interested in studying the maximum ratio clique problem (MRCP) that is a variant of the classical maximum weight clique problem. For a given graph, we suppose that each vertex of the graph is weighted by a pair of rational numbers. The objective of MRCP consists in finding a maximal clique with the largest ratio between two sets of weights that are assigned to its vertices. It has been proven that the decision version of this problem is NP-complete and it is hard to solve MRCP for large instances. Hence, this paper looks for introducing an efficient approach based on Difference of Convex functions (DC) programming and DC Algorithm (DCA) for solving MRCP. Then, we verify the performance of the proposed method. For this purpose, we compare the solutions of DCA with the previously published results. As a second objective of this paper, we identify some valid inequalities and evaluate empirically their influence in solving MRCP. According to the numerical experiments, DCA provides promising and competitive results. Furthermore, the introduction of the valid inequalities improves the computational time of the classical approaches.},

	Abstract = {Consider a graph in which every vertex has two non-negative weights. In this graph, the maximum ratio clique problem (MRCP) searches for a maximal clique that maximizes a fractional function defined by the ratio of the sums of vertex weights. It has been proved that MRCP is NP-hard and, consequently, it is difficult to solve MRCP by exact methods. Due to this fact, we present the first heuristic approach, i.e., a multi-start Variable Neighborhood Search (MS-VNS) algorithm. In order to verify the performance of our MS-VNS, we use standard instances and according to our observations, our MS-VNS approach provides high-quality solutions in a short computation time. Furthermore, on most of the instances, our algorithm outperforms the classical methods that have already been used for solving MRCP.},

Based on the analysis, we propose an improved competitive Hopfield network algorithm (ICHN). In ICHN, we introduce a flexible weight definition method which excites the competitive dynamics, and we also present an initial values setting strategy which efficiently increases the probability of finding optimal solutions. Furthermore, an inhibitive competitive activation mechanism is introduced to form a new input updating rule which reduces significantly the number of neurons with an intermediate level of activations. Our algorithm effectively overcomes the flaw of the DCHOM, and exhibits powerful solving ability for the MCP. Experiments on the benchmark problems and practical applications verify the validity of our algorithm.</p>},

In this study, we develop two efficient local search algorithms for MWCP, namely SCCWalk and SCCWalk4L, where SCCWalk4L is improved from SCCWalk for large graphs. There are two main ideas in SCCWalk, including strong configuration checking (SCC) and walk perturbation. SCC is a new variant of a powerful strategy called configuration checking for local search. The walk perturbation procedure is used to lead the algorithm to leave the current area and come into a new area of feasible solution space. Moreover, to improve the performance on massive graphs, we apply a low-complexity heuristic called best from multiple selection to select the swapping vertex pair quickly and effectively, resulting in the SCCWalk4L algorithm. In addition, SCCWalk4L uses two recent reduction rules to decrease the scale of massive graphs. We carry out experiments to evaluate our algorithms on several popular benchmarks, which are divided into two groups, including classical benchmarks of small graphs namely DIMACS, BHOSLIB, winner determination problem, and graphs derived from clustering aggregation, as well as massive graphs, including a suite of massive real-world graphs and large-scale FRB graphs. Experiments show that, compared to state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms and exact algorithm, the proposed algorithms perform better on classical benchmarks, and obtain the best solutions for most massive graphs."
